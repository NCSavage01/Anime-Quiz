# Anime Quiz(This is usually at the top of a repo's main README.md file.)

## This is a short trivia game based off of famous anime known today, It include questions like finish the phrase and guess the logo.

_(What inspired me to make this game is doing anime quiz on youtube videos and my love for anime.)_


## Deployment

The web game is deployed at NCSavage01.github.io (YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL).


## Game Logic

```

Within the program the user hits either the start button or the instructions button, if the user hits the instructions button then a alert for the instructions will display.Once the user hits the start button the game will display the first question along with the answer choices and the next button. When the user hits an answer choice the right answer will be highlighted green and the rest of the answer choices will be highlighted red.Based if the user hits the right answer they will receive 100 points, if the user hits the wrong answer they will receive 0 points. Then the user will hit the next question button. It will continue until the final question is answered. At the end it will count up the final score and say thanks for playing.

### Post-MVP Plans
One post-mvp plan i have is to get the soundtrack add and working.
A stretch goal would be making a animated character on the side with thumbs up or down.
